# btree-traversal-and-implementation
Construct a b tree with values proVided in one line of data from an input file after parsing command file to find the degree of the btree.
The command file can then ask the user to print any level of the btree after being constructed, as well as ask it to perform in order traversal to print the entire btree.

# Notes
- The 9 "input7x.txt" files are the 9 input files that were used to test this code
- The 9 "output7x.txt" files are the files outputted by the program.
- The 9 "ans7x.txt" files are files containing the correct output that should occur from each corresponding input file, and are available
for comparison to the outputs files to ensure correct output. 
- The 9 "command7x.txt" files contain the command the code must parse through and execute.
- This code was tested on the University of Houston's Linux server and passed all the test cases.
- The "ArgumentManager.h" file parses arguments to sequentially open the 9 input files to automatically test the code on the server.
- The "test.sh" file is a SHELL script for automatically testing the input files on the Linux server.
- The "compile.sh" file is  SHELL script for automatically compiling the code on the Linux server before running the tests.
